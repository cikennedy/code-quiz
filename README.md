# homework04: Code Quiz

## Usage 

This repository contains a timed multiple choice quiz with coding questions relevant to the Bootcamp's fourth week of classes. There is a 75 second timer that will start once the user begins the quiz. The user will choose between four possible answers for each question. For each incorrect answer, ten seconds will be subtracted from the timer as a penalty. 

Once all questions have been answered or if the timer reaches zero, the quiz will end. 

Once the quiz is over, the user will be able to enter their initials in order to save their score.
